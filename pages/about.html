    <h2>A little bit about me...</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a 36 years old Brazilian who likes to travel, bike everywhere and take care of my plants and cats.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've been working in the technology business for almost 5 years now, in which the last 2 years I've been working as a Fullstack Developer.
        I'm graduated as a Journalist, and I believe my communications background helps me to be a better frontend developer 
        because I can easily transit between product, customer, and tech areas, aggregating value for my team.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Fun fact:</strong> I worked as a flight attendant for 7 years before becoming a developer.
    </p>
    <p>
        My main goal as a developer is to continuously improve my front-end skills, that's why I decided to make this uglish webiste, so I get to practice some more html! 
    </p>

        Thanks for stopping by! (:
